Welcome to the MobileX Labs DevBlog. Here's where our team will be posting interesting discoveries, announcements and code tips.

We'll be posting things relevant to: Ruby (Rails), CoffeeScript (JS), iOS (Objective-C, C, C++, _even Swift_) and Lua (Corona SDK). As well as any other news coming from our engineering team.

As of this first post, we're powering this with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), using a modified version of the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
